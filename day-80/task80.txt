Full-stack developers are like jacks-of-all-trades in the software development world. They have the skills to build entire applications, working on both the user-facing side (front-end) and the behind-the-scenes logic (back-end). On the other hand, software engineers are specialists. They dive deep into a specific area of software development, like front-end development or working on mobile apps.

Here's the breakdown:

* **Full-stack developers** wear many hats. They can design what users see and interact with (front-end) and also handle the server-side logic that makes everything function.
* **Software engineers** are the in-depth experts. They focus on a particular area and become highly skilled in that domain.

While they have different approaches, both full-stack developers and software engineers need to collaborate, solve problems, and constantly learn new things to keep up with the ever-changing tech world.

The best path for you depends on your preferences. Do you like a broad range of skills or a deep specialization? Consider this when choosing between becoming a full-stack developer or a software engineer.
