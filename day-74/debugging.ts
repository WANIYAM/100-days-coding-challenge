// Here's a small snippet of my TypeScript code and how I debugged it:

function greet(name: string): string {
    console.log("Entering greet function");
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

const message = greet("Waniya");
console.log(message);

/*
Setting breakpoints and stepping through this code helped me see the function's flow and variable changes.
 This hands-on experience with TypeScript debugging has been incredibly enlightening and has sharpened 
 my problem-solving skills.
