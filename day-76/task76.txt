Summary of DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS (Domain Name System) is essential for navigating the internet, functioning like a phonebook for websites. When you want to visit a website, you typically use its domain name (e.g., www.example.com), but your browser needs the corresponding IP address to locate and access the website. DNS translates the human-readable domain names into IP addresses, enabling your browser to find and load the desired website.

Here's a simplified analogy:
- **Phonebook Analogy:** Just as you can call a friend by selecting their name from your phonebook, your browser uses DNS to find the IP address associated with a domain name.
- **DNS Process:** When you enter a domain name, the DNS system goes through several steps (like querying DNS servers) to retrieve the correct IP address, allowing your browser to connect to the website.

This process involves multiple servers and steps, but the fundamental concept is that DNS serves as the intermediary that translates domain names into IP addresses, ensuring seamless web browsing.

Key Points:
- DNS is like a phonebook for the internet.
- It translates domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses.
- This translation allows browsers to locate and load websites.

What is DHCP?

DHCP is a protocol that automatically assigns unique IP addresses to devices on a network. This eliminates the need for manual configuration and simplifies network management.

How it works:

1. New device joins:A new device broadcasts a message seeking a DHCP server.
2. DHCP server offers address: The router's DHCP server offers an available IP address to the device.
3. Device requests address: The device requests the offered IP address.
4. Server acknowledges: The server acknowledges the request, finalizing the assignment.
5. Lease and renewal: The IP address is assigned for a specific lease time, requiring periodic renewals by the device.

Benefits:

* Automatic configuration: No manual setup needed for each device.
* Scalability: DHCP can handle new devices joining the network.
* Efficiency: Tracks available addresses and reassigns them for optimal use.
